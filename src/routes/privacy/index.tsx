        We value your privacy and want to be transparent about how we collect,
        use, and protect your data. This Privacy Policy explains the types of
        information we may collect from you, how we use it, and the measures

          to input and edit your resume content. This data is
          <strong> stored in your device’s local storage</strong> (and not on our
          servers) so that only you have access to it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>

        We use <strong>Umami Cloud analytics</strong> to collect basic usage
        information about how you interact with the App, such as page views,

        data helps us understand how the App is being used and improve our
